#The ACommunity App is a networking app exclusively for students of Acity. The app is not just a place where students can check grades, meal plans, and request for transcripts (like the Acity plus 2.0 app). Students can use their accounts to share information, posts that can like and share, market their business, follow other students
#The App was built with React and Sass
#The Backend of the app is not yet complete, but the app is responsive, and can change from light mode to dark mode
#There is a register page, login page, and the actual app
